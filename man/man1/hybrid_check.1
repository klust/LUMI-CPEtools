.SH NAME
hybrid_check \- Simple "Hello, World!"-style hybrid MPI/OpenMP program

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhybrid_check\fR is a simple "Hello, World!"-style hybrid MPI/OpenMP program
that can print some information about where it is running.

Each thread prints a line with its MPI rank, OpenMP thread number, the core
number and the node name the thread is running on.
The output is sorted according to the MPI rank and OpenMP thread number
within each MPI rank. One can also label each call to \fBhybrid_check\fR
which is great for
distinguishing between the output of different components of a
heterogeneous job, and information on the pinning of each thread.

The number of threads per rank can be set through the OMP_NUM_THREADS
environment variable, and the MPI processes should be started using
\fBsrun\fR with the appropriate options for your environment.
When started without \fBsrun\fR,
it will just run a single instance of the program, in which case
it would actually show what a regular OpenMP program would do.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print help information about the command
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fI\,LABEL\/\fR, \fB\--label\fR \fI\,LABEL\/\fR
Label the output of this process with \fI\,LABEL\/\fR. This automatically
enables displaying labels.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR \fI\,TIME\/\fR
keeps all allocated CPUs busy for approximately \fI\,TIME\/\fR seconds
computing the surface of the Mandelbrot fractal with a naive
Monte Carlo algorithm so that a user can logon to the nodes
and see what is happening. At the end it will print the
allocation of the threads again as the OS may have improved
the spreading of the threads over the cores.
If different values are given for different parts in a
heterogeneous job, the largest will be used and applied to all
components of the heterogeneous job.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Show the NUMA affinity mask: Once ASCII character per virtual core,
where a number or capital letter denotes that the core can be used
and the number or letter denotes the NUMA group (or a * if the
number of the NUMA group would be 36 or larger) and a dot denotes
that the core is not used.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Numeric representation of the affinity mask as a series of core
or ranges of cores.
.TP
\fB--no-hostname\fR
Do not show the hostname in the output.
.TP
\fB--no-cpu\fR
Do not show the CPU number in the output
.TP
\fB--slurmvars\fR
Show the value of \fBSLURM_NODEID\fR, \fBSLURM_LOCALID\fR and
\fBSLURM_PROCID\fR. 
This option helps to analyse the effect of MPI rank reordering, but only
makes sense if the MPI ranks are started through \fBsrun\fR.
.TP
\fB--fp\fR
"Physical output format" showing host, CPU and numeric mask
(but no Slurm variables).
.TP
\fB--fr\fR
"Relative output format" or "reproducible output format", showing
the Slurm variables from \fB--slurmvars\fR and numeric mask, 
but not the hostname or CPU number.

.PP
In a heterogeneous job, the \fB\-w\fR, \fB\-n\fR and \fB\-r\fR options need to be specified for
only one of the components of the job but will apply to all components.

.SH EXAMPLE

The following is a job script to start a heterogeneous job in Slurm that
shows many features of this program:

.EX
#! /bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=2:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=4 --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH hetjob
#SBATCH --ntasks=2 --cpus-per-task=8

srun --ntasks=4 --cpus-per-task=4 hybrid_check -l exe1 -w 15 -n -r : \\
     --ntasks=2 --cpus-per-task=8 hybrid_check -l exe2
.EE

This script simulates a heterogeneous job running in a single MPI_COM_WORLD
universum with an instance of \fBhybrid_check\fR labeled exe1 running in
4 MPI ranks with 4 threads each and a second instance labeled exe2 running
in 2 MPI ranks with 8 threads each. It will also simulate some load during
approximately 15 seconds, and before and after that print the distribution
of threads including the affinity in the two supported formats.
You may have to add the appropriate \fBmodule load\fR commands to the script
to ensure that \fBhybrid_check\fR works, and the script also assumes that it
is in the search path for executables. You also have to add the partition and
account to use.

However the program can even be run as a regular
single multithreaded executable without using \fBsrun\fR. E.g., the following
job script would run \fBhybrid_check\fR in shared memory mode on 8 cores:

.EX
#! /bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=0:20
#SBATCH --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=8

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
export OMP_PROC_BIND=true
hybrid_check -l test -w 15 -n -r
.EE
